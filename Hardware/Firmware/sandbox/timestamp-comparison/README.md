# Timestamp analysis firmware
For the purpose of evaluating timestamp accuracy using NTP, this firmware outputs a milliseconds reslution timestamps, either over the serial monitor or BLE.
**Environments:**
- `wired`
- TODO `ble`: sets the BLE build flag to 1, activating BLE transmissions (in binary)
