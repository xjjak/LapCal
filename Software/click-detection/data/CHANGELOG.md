# Changes

- 2023-10-14 10:22: Trying to plot datasets with Mr. Drews plotting tool to
  1. hopefully generate some nice graphics for documentation (and maybe visual correctness reasoning)
  2. get more visual insight into the way the data differentiates.
     
  *Unfortunately this at the very least will have to be postponed since the given program is error prone and does currently not work well enough.*
- 2023-10-15 09:24: Reorganize data files to directories to have cleaner structure when merging data in the future.
