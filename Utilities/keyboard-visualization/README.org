* Keyboard visualisation
/written in rust, to try the language/

The program takes binary input via ~stdin~ in the format as specified in [[../Software/README.org]] and visualizes the virtual keyboard's state.

* Usage
To use the program run ~cargo build -r~ in the directory, afterwards the program's binary is found in
#+BEGIN_SHELL
./target/release/keyboard-visualization
#+END_SHELL

** Demo
As a demonstration, a small bash script ~simulate-input~ is included:
#+BEGIN_SHELL
./simulate-input | ./target/release/keyboard-visualization
#+END_SHELL
